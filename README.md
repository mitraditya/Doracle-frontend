  <strong>A one-stop solution to monitor your patient - for the families as well as
hospitals.</strong><br>
</p>

<p>
  Doracle is a patient management system useful for hospitals as well as patients. We intend to develop a secure, scalable application that adopts a set of revolutionizing steps that will pave the way to a better-managed hospital that will be able to provide superior healthcare advantages to its patients. Families no longer have to wait in long queues in dire situations waiting to know how their patient is. They will be provided a unique login credential for their patient with which, they will be able to login into the application and access real-time updates on the treatment status of their patients.
</p>

<strong>Doracle is made with the MERN Stack, however this is just the Frontend part of our code, and is made using React JS.</strong>

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* *Declarative:* React makes it painless to create interactive UIs.
* *Component-Based:*
